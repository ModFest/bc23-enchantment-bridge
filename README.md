# Blanketcon 23 Enchantment Bridge
This is a mod made for Blanketcon 2023 that sets up the different enchanting/enchantment related mods to individually be able to show their features off.

This is exclusively meant for Blanketcon 2023 and is not meant for proper survival settings.

## Setup
- To set this mod up for building, you will need to download [Enchantery](https://github.com/AstralOrdana/Enchantery/) off of its GitHub releases as the mod is not ready for play yet.
- Put this JAR in the gradle/libs folder, and you'll be good to build the mod.

## What changes does this make?
I'm glad you asked, outside of configurations, the changes are below:
**General**
- Better Enchantment Boosting, Enchancement and Enchantery's enchantment table changes are all separated into their own blocks.
**Better Enchantment Boosting**
- 
**Enchancement**
- Vanilla enchantments kept by Enchancement have had their features reverted and put into a new enchantment that acts like the old one if it were in Enchancement by default.
- The Enchancement Enchanting Table is now unable to retrieve non Enchancement enchantments.
- Enchancement enchantments are incompatible with all other Enchantments, even when `singleEnchantmentMode` is false.
- Tridents only have built-in Loyalty alongside Enchancement enchantments.
